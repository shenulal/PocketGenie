## üöÄ How to Access

1. Open PocketGenie app
2. Tap the **‚ú® sparkle icon** in the top-right corner of the home screen
3. You'll see the AI Features screen with two tabs

## üìù Tab 1: Summarize

### What It Does
Analyzes text and creates:
- A concise summary paragraph
- Up to 10 key bullet points

### How to Use
1. Tap the **Summarize** tab
2. Paste or type text in the text field
3. Tap **Summarize** button
4. View results in the green card

### Example
**Input:**
```
Project management involves planning, executing, and controlling work 
to achieve specific goals. The main challenges are managing scope, time, 
quality, and budget constraints while meeting success criteria.
```

**Output:**
```
Summary: Project management coordinates team work to achieve goals 
within constraints of scope, time, quality, and budget.

Bullet Points:
- Involves planning, executing, and controlling work
- Main goal is achieving project objectives
- Must manage scope, time, quality, and budget

## üéØ Tab 2: Prioritize

### What It Does
Analyzes your tasks and provides:
- **Next Best Action** - The most important task to do now
- **AI Reasoning** - Why tasks are prioritized this way
- **Prioritized Order** - Numbered list of tasks in recommended order

### How to Use
1. Create at least 3 tasks with different priorities
2. Tap the **Prioritize** tab
3. Tap **Prioritize Tasks** button
4. View results in the green card

### Example
**Your Tasks:**
- Buy groceries (Low priority)
- Finish report (High priority, Due tomorrow)
- Call client (Urgent, Due today)

**AI Result:**
```
Next Best Action: ‚≠ê Call client (Urgent, Due today)

AI Reasoning: The task "Call client" is urgent and due today, 
making it the highest priority.

Prioritized Order:
1. Call client (Due: Today)
2. Finish report (Due: Tomorrow)
3. Buy groceries (No due date)
```

3. Tap Summarize
4. Check results appear in green card
```

### Test Prioritization (2 minutes)
```
