## üìã Features Overview

### Feature 1: Summarization

**What It Does**
- Analyzes any text you provide
- Generates a concise summary paragraph
- Creates up to 10 key bullet points
- Preserves important information

**How to Use**
1. Enter text in the input field
2. Tap "Summarize" button
3. Wait for AI to process (2-5 seconds)
4. View results in green card

**Example**
```
Input: "Project management involves planning, executing, and 
controlling work to achieve specific goals. The main challenges 
are managing scope, time, quality, and budget constraints."

Output:
Summary: Project management coordinates team work to achieve 
goals within constraints.

Bullet Points:
- Involves planning, executing, and controlling work
- Main goal is achieving project objectives
- Must manage scope, time, quality, and budget
```

### Feature 2: Prioritization

**What It Does**
- Analyzes all your tasks
- Ranks them by urgency and importance
- Recommends the "Next Best Action"
- Provides reasoning for prioritization

**How to Use**
1. Create at least 3 tasks with different priorities
2. Go to "Prioritize" tab
3. Tap "Prioritize Tasks" button
4. Wait for AI analysis (2-5 seconds)
5. View results in green card

**Example**
```
Your Tasks:
- Buy groceries (Low)
- Finish report (High, Due tomorrow)
- Call client (Urgent, Due today)

AI Result:
Next Best Action: ‚≠ê Call client (Urgent, Due today)

Reasoning: The task "Call client" is urgent and due today, 
making it the highest priority.

Prioritized Order:
1. Call client (Due: Today)
2. Finish report (Due: Tomorrow)
3. Buy groceries (No due date)
```
