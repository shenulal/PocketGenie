1. Open the app
2. Look at the top AppBar (header)
3. Tap the **‚ú® (sparkle/auto_awesome)** icon
4. You'll see the AI Features Testing screen

### Alternative Navigation
- From any screen, you can navigate to `/ai-features` route

## üß™ Feature 1: AI Content Summarization

### What It Does
The AI analyzes any text you provide and creates:
- A concise summary paragraph
- Key bullet points (up to 10)

### How to Test

**Step 1: Enter Text**
1. Go to the **Summarize** tab
2. Paste or type text in the text field
3. Example text to try:
   ```
   Project Management is the practice of initiating, planning, executing, 
   controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals 
   and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary 
   challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals 
   and objectives while honoring the preconceived constraints. The main 
   constraints are scope, time, quality, and budget.
   ```

**Step 2: Summarize**
1. Tap the **Summarize** button
2. Wait for the AI to process (2-5 seconds)
3. View the result in the green success card

**Step 3: Verify Results**
- ‚úÖ Summary paragraph appears
- ‚úÖ Bullet points are generated
- ‚úÖ Key information is captured

### Expected Output
```
Summary: Project management involves initiating, planning, executing, 
controlling, and closing work to achieve specific goals. The main 
challenges include managing scope, time, quality, and budget constraints.

Bullet Points:
- Project management is the practice of coordinating team work
- Primary goal is achieving project objectives within constraints
- Main constraints are scope, time, quality, and budget
- Success requires meeting preconceived criteria
- Effective management balances all constraint factors
```

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Error: Connection refused"**
- Backend is not running
- Solution: Start backend with `docker-compose up -d`

**Issue: "Error: Request timeout"**
- Z.ai server is not responding
- Solution: Check backend logs with `docker-compose logs backend`

**Issue: Empty result**
- Text might be too short
- Solution: Try with longer text (at least 50 words)

## üéØ Feature 2: AI Task Prioritization

### What It Does
The AI analyzes all your tasks and:
- Ranks them by urgency and importance
- Recommends the "Next Best Action"
- Provides reasoning for the prioritization

### How to Test

**Step 1: Create Test Tasks**
1. Go to **Tasks** tab
2. Create at least 3 tasks with different priorities:
   - Task 1: "Buy groceries" - Priority: Low
   - Task 2: "Finish project report" - Priority: High, Due: Tomorrow
   - Task 3: "Call client" - Priority: Urgent, Due: Today
   - Task 4: "Review code" - Priority: Medium

**Step 2: Access Prioritization**
1. Go to **AI Features** screen
2. Tap the **Prioritize** tab
3. You'll see your tasks listed

**Step 3: Run Prioritization**
1. Tap the **Prioritize Tasks** button
2. Wait for AI analysis (2-5 seconds)
3. View results in the green success card

**Step 4: Analyze Results**

The result shows:

**A. Next Best Action** (highlighted in amber)
- The single most important task to focus on
- Based on urgency, due date, and priority

**B. AI Reasoning**
- Explanation of how tasks were prioritized
- Considers due dates, priority levels, and urgency

**C. Prioritized Order**
- Numbered list of tasks in recommended order
- Shows due dates for each task

### Expected Output Example

```
Next Best Action:
‚≠ê Call client
   (Priority: Urgent, Due: Today)

AI Reasoning:
The task "Call client" has been prioritized as the next best action 
because it has an urgent priority level and is due today. This task 
should be completed immediately to avoid missing the deadline.

Prioritized Order:
1. Call client (Due: Today)
2. Finish project report (Due: Tomorrow)
3. Review code (No due date)
4. Buy groceries (No due date)
```

### Testing Scenarios

**Scenario 1: All tasks have same priority**
- Create 3 tasks with same priority
- AI will sort by due date
- Tasks with earlier due dates rank higher

**Scenario 2: Mix of urgent and low priority**
- Create mix of urgent and low priority tasks
- AI should recommend urgent tasks first
- Verify "Next Best Action" is urgent

**Scenario 3: No due dates**
- Create tasks without due dates
- AI will prioritize by priority level
- Verify sorting is correct

**Scenario 4: Complex scenario**
- Create 5+ tasks with various priorities and due dates
- AI should handle complex prioritization
- Verify reasoning makes sense
